To use this app, all you need is to download two branches into your local machine
Including: "main" for the frontend of the app and "bach_end" for the backend

1. You start off by deploying the backend server with 'npm start' on your "back_end" branch
2. The last step to make the app running is to use the same 'npm start' command on the "main" branch to start up the frontend
