## Website project for Advanced programming course
To use this app, all you need is to download two branches into your local machine
Including: "Front-end" for the frontend of the app and "minh_code" for the backend
### Dont forget to use the 'npm install' command for all your local repos before proceeding with any further instruction
1. You start by deploying the backend server with 'npm start' on your "minh_code" branch
2. The last step to make the app running is to use the same 'npm start' command on the "Front-End" branch to start up the frontend
